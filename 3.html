<h2>America</h2>
<p>The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization of American States (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP.[28] The U.S. economy is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world.[29] Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total,[30] the U.S. holds 33.4% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country.[31] The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage,[32] human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person.[33] The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending,[34] and is a leading political, cultural, and scientific force internationally.[35]
